## Wee in a bucket

Wee into a bucket diluted 1:1 with water. Can pour one bucket a day onto the garden. 
High in nitrogen so don't over do it.

## Kitchen scrap compost

Have a roll of wire to make the frame, then add kitchen scraps, sawdust (CARBON) & grass clippings (NITROGEN). Once full, move the frame & then move the existing compost back into
the chicken coop. Add sawdust & grass clippings as you go. Repeat till you have compost.
