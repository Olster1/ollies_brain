Heart & blood:

Heart hasn't always been a heart, but appeared in Italy 16th century

Heart disease is the biggest killer in the world

Our heart is a really good pump. The force of blood in your main arteries in phenomenonal. Your blood clots cuts using platelets, but cant clot main arteries. That's why you need clips in surgery.

Four types of blood groups related to how they group when spun. A can't group with B, ab can group with a or b, group 0 (zero) has not grouping. It's related to their antigens (the proteins on the surface of the cells). There are more antigens then just the four types, but they form these groups.

Blood transfusions are actually not that good idea with old blood, contaminated blood (aids & hepC)& disrupting the bloods mechanism to self regulate. Trying to make artificial blood using nano polymers  but no success yet, maybe next 10yrs.

Blood letting is a bad idea (LOLs) Abraham Lincoln died of blood letting & was part of the dark ages of medicine (1600s to start of 1900s) where diseases weren't treated as specific symptoms but as a unequalibrium of the body. Too much blood, warm blood.
