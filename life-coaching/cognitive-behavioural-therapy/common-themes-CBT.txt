 Once again, positive emotional change comes from
changing the way you think about yourself, about other people, and the
world in general. If you want to be emotionally healthy and high-functioning,
you need to start developing flexible, tolerant, and accepting attitudes.

Forming flexible preferences, vs rigid demands. 

Accept other people & yourself as Failable Human beings - people can do wrong behaviours but so can you & it's unreasonable to accept other people to not make mistakes or have dificulties just like you. 

Tackle toxic thoughts and replace them with realistic renderings, pertinent preferences, additional acceptances,
self-acceptance, and high frustration tolerance.

Top Beliefs to have:

1. youâ€™re an unrateable, complex, ever-changing, fallible human (key to self acceptance which leads to healthier emotions)


When developing Core Beliefs think about what you'd want to instill in a child.
