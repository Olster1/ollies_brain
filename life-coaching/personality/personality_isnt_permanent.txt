Personality Isn't Permanent: Break Free from Self-Limiting Beliefs and Rewrite Your Story

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The most fundmental aspect of your humanity is your ability to make choices and stand by those choices - Victor Frankl called the last of human freedoms. "To choose one's own way". To choose your own way has two key points: making decisions about what you want to happen and choosing how to respond to what does happen. The more you own the the POWER of your decision making, the more your life and outcomes will be within your control. 

The two most critical factors influencing our ability to make choices are our social & cultural environment, and our emotional development as a person. The more emotionally evolved we can become, the less the environment governs our choices. 

Personality is not innate, but TRAINED. 

For you to become your NEW person, your must have a goal - a purpose worth pursuing. Your goal is the reason you aquire new skills, and have curated transformational experiences. 

Without a meaningful goal, attempting to change your personality lacks meaning, requires unsustainable willpower, and ultimately will fail. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Transformation - chaning themselves and their lives - comes from their view of their future. They see something different and more meaningful and they never stop fuelling that vision. They refuse to be defined by their past. 

You are not 'caused' by your past. Your attention, energy and narrative about your self should focus on the future, not the past. Where your going as a person. 

People become who they want to become by orientating their life towards their goals, not as a repeat of their past.
