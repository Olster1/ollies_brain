Parenting Notes

------------------------------

Deep play is key.
- LEGO 
- Gardening 
- Warhammer - painting, playing the game
- Playstation & Switch: Crash Bandicoot, Spyro & Zelda
- Cooking 
- Playing music together - 


FIRST LEVEL: sheltering, feeding & providing a stable routine
SECOND LEVEL: developing emotional bonds - deep play is at the core. 

Slowing down and reclaiming your child's right to play. Live hectic lives, kids have the right to slow down and deep play. 
(When child see's you check your phone, they are going to lose attention on the activity their doing faster).

-----------------------------------------

Treating our children with compassion & respect - just as if they were an adult. 

- Most important thing we can do is build a strong, positive relationship with them - solid ground for communicating to each other, so they feel like they are heard, feel safe and loved.

- It's never to late to start building a loving, close, attached realtionship with your child. 

- [Joyful, loving interactions] and [secure atttachement] are vital building blocks for self worth, social and physical development and emotional intelligence. 

How to build a close relationship:

1. each day spend quality, playful time with your child. Give them you undivided attention in this period. 
2. truley listen to them when they speak
3. Treat them as equals. Respect their opinions and knowledge, just like you would with an adult.
4. Give them freedom to try new things. 
5. Don't say no too often - frame things as positive alternatives: instead of "no running inside", say "running is for outside"
6. Speak kindly about them to others - escpecially when they are listening 
7. help them if they ask; don't if they don't - they are capable of asking for themselves 

- With nov-violent, non-discepline and attachment parenting, we are not advocating for permissive parenting where anything goes. We still have limits and boundaries. Rules like for physcial harm to others and self, and destructive behaiours. But you can communicate and work out the boundary as a team, instead of dictating it to the child. 

- Instead of discipline, seek to understand what needs are underlying their behaviours. All behvaiour is a result of their needs not being met. Can you communicate with them in a way to understand them? 


- What belief's do you want to instill in your child and how do you want to prepare them for when they're an adult? 


Non-violent communication protocol

1. Observe - obeserve what we see instead of judging. "He woke up 5 times last night" instead of "He's a teribble sleeper". Avoid labeling

2. Feelings - observe your feelings about the situation. Try not to masquerade your feelings as labeling the other person's actions "I feel like they're not respecting me by waking up so much", instead come back to how your feeling, outside of the event. "I feel tired and lonely". 

3. Needs - what are your needs that need to be met. I need more rest, or more space.

4. Request - communicate your request to significant others. "can you help me get some time alone?" - remember to frame it as a request not a demand. Demand only has two options fo the other person - rebellion or submission - has to be a choice by the other person. 

5. Empathy - help show the other person how they're feeling, "I know your feeling tired, but is there some way we could work out how I could get some time alone today?".


------------------------------------------

Creating a ryhtmic environment where there is predictability

Breathing in moments - playing with the kids 
Breathing out moments - alone time when you get some space to do your own thing - kids watch tv, ipad, or play on their own. 

Rythm over routine - everything's not set in stone based on the time, but flow from one activity to the next in predictable ways. Bath before bed, then read a story and listen to sleep music. 

Use anchors thoughout the day to structure things.

Rythmic meal times:
Use set meal types of each day to help provide structure for the kids. 
Batch cooking food once a week - vegetables etc. an activity.

Within the meal there can be structure:
- Wash hands at the start of the meal
- light candle at start of the meal
- put table cloth and lay the table
- putting distractions away
- Sharing a poem, prayer, blessings before the meal 
- Gratitute practice of saying something you were grateful for. 

Rythmic Bedtimes:
-Include shower or bath to wind down
-lighting a candle
-Using lavender oil 
-Giving child gentle massage before bed
- Introduce a bedtime snack.
- Say goodnight to toys
- Listen to bedtime meditation
- Offerring a story
- Laying out clothes fo the next morning

Rythmic activites:

-Afternoon tea
- Sharing things over afternoon tea like board games and such
- Going for walks outside at particular times
- Doing things on particular days of the week like going out to dinner

----
TRANSITIONS

Moving from one activity to the next. Help your child navigate this transition. eg. Have been playing and now time for bed. How will to navigate this? 

- Singing a simple song to mark the transition 
- Let them know what is coming "two more splashes then we have to go home for lunch", "time to feed the ducks one more time".

Working self-care into you daily rythms. 

- doing the things that top you up like: listening to a podcast, reading a chapter of your book, getting some breating room

---
When creating your daily rythms think about two things:
1. what needs to happen: work outside or inside the house, homework/schoolwork, chores
2. what would you like to happen: playdates, going for a run, trip to the pool 

Sites of Mutual Fufillment (SMF) - where both parties (kids and adults) come away with a full cup. Things you like doing together. 
- Video game together
- Painting warhammer together
- Drawing

Keeping Rythm for neurodiverse children (escpecially on unpredicatable days or days that stray from the norm)

- using visuals to help show your child whats happening - calanders, visual routine steps & "now, next, later" cards

- Sensory input such as "heavy work" like digging or pulling something heavy can help regulate anxiety due to change (swimming)


Two family homes: 

- keep the dates that the child moves between homes consistent
- Remind the child when they will be spending time with the other parent
- Create small rituals around the transition of leaving home and coming back - same snack pack they take
- Focus on rythm in your own own - you can't control what the other houshold does. Come back to the anchors thoughout the day. 

----- 

Working from home with kids
- have to flexible of what work looks like. You might only get a 20 minute gap to do something - it might be on your phone - it's not going to look prefect. 

A working rythm can help: 
- Find the non-negotiables for work (like video calls with others, or alloted space to do deep work) and use these as anchors for the day. 
- Be flexible about when you work 
- Invite children to work next to you - set up workspace for them to work on their things. 
- Prioritise your tasks ruthlessley - can't just see what happens or enjoy infinte stretches of time - set boundaries around your time. 
- Use support for childcare - playdates, childcare & nannies.
- Be kind to yourself
- Use the 'breath in, breath out' pattern to help fill the child's cup of emotional connection, so you can then go and do more work. 


---
Weekend rythm:

Weekends can be different to weekdays, were there is traditionally more unstructured time. 
- Try not pack so much into a weekend
- prioritise what you want to get out of the weekend - more family connection, more rest. 
- Create enough space on your weekends to allow for the them to be flexible, but enough structure that they don't just pass you by.
- If you find weekdays melting into weekends creating rituals can help define them. 
- Saturday bike rides, Sunday pancakes

Seasonal rythms: 

Using the seasons as a rythm to connect to. 
things like:
- growing sunflowers each year. 
- new slippers each autumn
- choosing a christmas tree each year.
- carving pumpkins in autumn
- bring out seasonal books 
- create trasitions around fesitvals you celebrate

The moments of 'what we do', that children can look back on in their adult years. 
----

Visual Rythms cues

- Basic tick chart 
- Daily rythm chart of images
- Rythm wheel for the seasons, so you know which part of the year their in. 

When life throws you a curve ball, concentrate on anchors throughout the day. 

Rhythm and structure helps young people - even teenagers feel safe. Kids and teenagers like to know what their day looks like and

Toys, play and the prepared envirnment

------------

'Prepared Environment' comes from the influential Italian educator - Montessori. It's designed to maximise independent learning & exploration. 
Space that's been intentionally designed. of giving them as much independence as possible. 

Six principles: 
1. Freedom
2. Structure & order
3. beauty
4. nature & reality
5. soical environment
6. intellectual environment

A space should be: 
 - calm & orderly
 - set up for children to do their own thing independently 
 - less is more - want to reduce viusal clutter and over-whelm
 - Make space through beauty - flowers, art & cultural objects. 


Montessori said "the things the child sees are not just remembered; they from part of their soul" 
- study found [ barrett et al. 2015 ] aesthetics add significant impact on their ability to learn. 

- natural light & fresh air the biggest factors
- sense of homliness through nice objects but not cluttred

----
Make space for beauty
- spring clean - regularly remove clutter - keep house tidy
---
FOr people who find cleaning hard: 
- Tidy up first = makes it alot easier to then clean
- Use lovely cleaning tools - make the job more appealing
- Listen to podcasts while cleaning 
- Use scented products 
- Do it with other people - partner or kids
---
- Small touches you can add - rugs, candles, soft music in the background, indoor plants
- Decluttering - getting rid of toys that aren't being used, donate clothes. 
- Find a space for everything
- create a yes space - where the child is free to touch, explore, move, climb & look after their needs - there are no rules to what the child can do, your not always telling them they can't do something. 

Give the children the tools for themselves to become independent like being able to get water for themselves. 

Creating an art room with craft materials accessible. 

Movement is linked into children's ability to learn - they need access to movement. The no brainer is outside in parks, pools & nature trails, but you can also setup spaces inside your home. 

- consider installing gymnatics bars or rings over the door for children to hang on - indoor monkey bars, ladders to other rooms etc. 
- outside can install climbing frame & trampoline 

Creating space for rest: 

- place to rest and get comfortable. 
- burn essentail oils
- turn on an audio book
- just have a few books & toys in the rest room
- Model rest yourself - show your kids how its done - put headphones on, read a book & notebook. 

---
Spaces & Play
---

Setup your home so children can get down to the important work of deep play. Play is the most important thing a child can do - Monsterri calling it the "work of childhood"
Children of all ages have an urgent need for unstructured time where they are able to freely follow their own ideas and interests and explore what they want to explore, act and move in the ways they want to act and move. 

[illustration idea:  Childs work is deep play]

Factors causing a reduce in play are:
- a hurried lifestyle
- changes in family strucutre (seperation)
- focus on academic subjects & enrichment activities (learning music instrucment), with less focus on instructured child-centerd play

Fostering an environment for play: 

- create play space near where you as an adult spend your time (like the kitchen or lounge room)
- set up the room that can spark interest 
- create invitations for children to play, even teenagers. Set things up the spark their interest and get them invovled. 

----
Toy Rotation 
----

Only keep few toys at once for kids to access to improve quality play. 
- reduce the number of choices your child has to make, reducing the stress they feel .
- toys feel freshers and novel

Fours steps to better concentration and deeper play: 

1. Observe your child 

- observe what your child does. Can you optimize the room for better play experience. What stops them playing? Are toys easily accessible? Are things put away in the same place, so kids know where they are for next time? 

2. Sort toys

- sort toys and ruthlessley getting rid of toys that are broken, child has outgrown, unnessarcy duplicates, cause conflict. 
- look for toys that encourage active play - using their imagination - rather than passive toys. 

3. Store 

- open shelves - kids can see what's available
- sort by type in open baskets


Things your putting away (rotating away)

- store in the garage, cupboard or wardrope

4. Observe again

- This is the most improtant stage (end of the lifecycle) 
- see what works and what doesn't. Do they ask for other toys that you've put away? 


Simplify - the fewer the toys, the deeper the play. 

Simplify the kids lives - you'll find they feel more connected, feel less overwhelmed and stressed, display fewer disorder behaviours & tendencies, get on better with their siblings, and play more deeply & independent. 

Simplifying also protects their childhood from adult life. 

---
Cultivating your home to encourage independent play
---

- Give you kid lots of quality time with you if you want them to play alone - fill up their emotional cup - make them feel safe and content in their attachment
- Build free time into your daily rythms. 
- When they are playing by themselves - stay close but stay busy - occupy yourself
- Provide toys and materials that spark their imaginations. 
- Respect their play - don't interupt them mid playing- wait till they are finished. 
- Rethink what play might look like (hint: it isn't always sitting quiet on the floor), it might me jumping about, dancing, making lots of noise, jumping on the furniture. Flow state is deep play. Construct your house to allow this. 
- Limit time screen - don't ban screens altogehter, but develop a rythm around when to use them. and help kids play more deeply. DOn't play movies while playing - help them stay in the state of FLOW. 

--------
Toy Ideas: 

- Duplo, LEGO, building blocks 
- Figures = animals, people, small dolls, furniture, farm
- Modelling materials = kinetic sand, playdough, clay, air-dry clay
- Loose parts = pebbles, shells, fabric strips, curtain rings, seeds etc. 
- Gross motor skill toys = scooter, balance board, trampoline, pedal bike, balls. 
- Imaganitive play & roleplay = dressups, old sheets, scarves, silk
- Water items = kitchen sink, kitchen utensils, dried flowers - making potions outside
- Puzzles = wooden puzzles, jugsaws, 
- Games = Uno, Bingo, Snakes & ladders
- Simple musical instruments = drums, whistle, rattles, xylophone

---------------------------------------------------------
Awkening you child's natural curiosity
---

Self education at home: 1. Strong connection to their parent, caregiver or teacher. 2. Security predictable rythms bring 3. environment set up to for exploration & fun. 

Home schooling is about building knowledge - more knowledge provides more opporutnities & increases children's potential. Building knowledge is king, becuase it is a positive feeback cycle. 

Two ways to help kids build knowlege:
1. Experince hands-on learning where the child is able to witness things. 
2. Reading widely or deeply about anything & everything, which helps deepen understanding or direct experiences. 

Watching documentaries, planning hands-on research projects & having converstaions with knowledgeable adults (like you). 

Give kids ways of exploring and seeing things in a different way - contact with insects might be to be scared of them, but do a project like a beast trap & they'll see things in a new light. 

Stress is the biggest factor the either enables or disables the abilty for kids to create new memory cells and learn better. Creating an environment that limits stress so they can't preform what they do best: learn. 

Home learning can be great because of this reason - it's where kids feel most compfortable, relaxed & safe. 

Avoid FOMO (fear of missing out) that can take away deep play & connection. 

To reduce stress in the home enviroment: 
- DOn't push your child too hard. 
- Weave moments of connection into your day
- Allow learning to be joyful, leaning into what your child wants to do & explore
- Take advantage of lack of alarm 
- If doing structured learning - keep lessons short
- Know when to call it quits to structured learning.
- Put the home in 'home education' - don't have to create a classroom enviroment

---
Homeschooling material checklist: 

- A wide selection of books - mic of non-ficiton, reference books (encyclopedia), poetry, biography 
- Good quality art materials - setup eaily in an art station
- mix of toys that encourage deep play
- globe, map or atlas
- basic science kit: binoculars, magnifying glass, prism, selection of magnets, bug viewer, seeds, compost, small pot to investigate plant cycle, proper microscope
- Maths materials: stopwatch, ruler, tape measure, scales, 
- device to watch documentaries & listen to audio books, 
- adventure backpack: torch, water bottle, notebook, cheap camera, specimen jar. 
- way to play music. 

--- 
Activity ideas: 

- sit down and make a list of all the things they want to do - stick it on the fridge
- Read, read, read = reading outloud can be the best thing yu can do as a parent - try to discuss the book afterwards, 
- listen to audiobooks & podcasts. 
- freeplay 
- play games - board games, computer games, card games
- throw tea party
- bake
- get outside 
- garden
- keep active
- arts & crafts
- take care of the home

----
For teenagers: 
- Create structure and rythm for them.  They like to know what their day looks like and what to expect. 
- Can you help them be part of a bigger community - choir, music groups, drama society, programming club  -outside of their family circle. 
- Can you find oppurtnitues fir them to succeed - something small like chores or making family meal. 
- Sit down with them to make a plan for their learning goals. 

---
You don;t need to be a teacher to give your child a top-notch education - you just need to know them, love them, and trust in their abiliy to learn. 

---
Socialising in home school: 

- playdates
- groups
- dinner nights or picnics with other families
- classes
- learning co-ops
- visiting friends and family members

-----------

Siblings Dynamics: 

- Trust their goodness - lean to giving them the benifit of the doubt
- Find time to do things together like nature walks, art projects - also make sure you spend time seperate from each other. 
- Stay away from comparision - comparing between siblings will harm your relationship with them, and each other
- Allow all feelings to come up - if they feel like they dont want a sibling don't say "you don't mean that, you really love your brother" - instead listen to them and hear them out. 
- Notice the moments of warmth & connection between siblings
- listen to everyone fairly - don't jump to conclusions, instead hear everyones side of the story, adn give everyone a fair chance. 
- Step in when neccessary - when one child is bullying the other - if someone gets hurt apoligise you didn't step in sooner = help remove the guilt from agressive child. 

When everyone needs your help at the same time: 

- prioritise safety
- don't be afraid to go back and forth between children's needs
- Sportcast alot - make sure you're communicating with them and they can see your trying to work something out - walk them through how they might be feeling. 
- Take time to reconnect all together - putting music on for a dance party, playing in the garden. 
- priotirtise needs. 

------------

Buildings child's motivation: 

Kids are motivated the same way we find motivation - things they find meangingful, have a pratcical purpose, and that interest them. 
MOtivation is less about what we say, and more about how we present things. Can you learn about a concept through something the kids are already interested in? Division and ratio's in baking. Are the opposite - use things they like doing and connect them to other things - drawing to describe science projects or history. 

----
Praise and rewards:
--
Avoid PRAISE & REWARDS as this leads to a fixed mindset. Conversley encourgaing children to put in effort and work hard. Comment positively on the PROCESS, not the finished product. "I noticed how hard you tried."  This is the belief that intelligence is fluid, adn can be grown and developed by putting in effort, working hard and not making mistakes. 

Extrenal rewards like praise and physical rewards leads to underminging the child's intirinsic motivation. A study found children who were praised for pro-social behaviour, were less likely to do it when not praised and are more likely to see themselves as a not 'nice person'. 

Being hooked on praise can lead in adulthood to focusing on people's reactions, more likely to quit when the praise stops, and less likely to take pride in their accomplishments. 

---
How to encourage you child without rewards: 

- Model the desired behaviour - when the child sees you doing the thing, they're more likely to want to replicate it in the short, medium and long term. If you want your child to be tidy, be tidy. If you want to encourage them to do more piano practice, you yourself do piano practice. 
- Be playful - play allows us to move away from CONTROL and move towards collaboration and joy.
- Bring things like science, math, hardwriting & reading to life in ways that will interest them - bring play into them, not boring book exercises. 
- build tasks into your daily rythm - with repition you can encourage children to do tasks
- Use reasoning - give them the reason why we should do this, and why they should - people don't like being given blanket instructions without a reason. 
- Tell them stories - tell stories about what you did as a child, or a story about a child you didn't want to brush their teeth, but overcame the fear and eventually did it. 
- Reframe challenenges - if your child is struggling, let them know it's alirght to struggle and it actually means we're learning. From age three, you can start talking to your child about the brain being plastic, and the more they practice, the easier it will get. 
- Check your expectations - are you pressureing your child with unchecked expectations?
