What would a beautiful childhood look like for you? 

Coming to mission beach and going down to the beach, going swimming at the creeks, going to dunk island, walking on the tracks, being less busy & less people. Doing the hobbies we love when we come here - painting warhammer, making lego, playing chess and painting.

Having a house in Adelaide that we can visit Jessie's mum, and do gardening there.
